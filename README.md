Repository consists of some helping scripts and Ipython notebook with an implemented clustering research on price changing of the gas data during montly trades. 

Pull repository and run the cells in [notebook.ipynb](notebook/notebook.ipynb) to see plotly charts and run through observation results and final conclusions.

There is a [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file in case something will go wrong with [environment.yml](environment.yml) :)
